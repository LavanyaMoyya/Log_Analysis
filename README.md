# Log Analysis Project

### by Lavanya

This is the project from udacity NanoDegree : [Fullstack Web Developer](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd004/dashboard/overview)

Aim of this project is to print report based on data in database by using python3 
and postgresql

### Here is your Tasks to Answer:-
1. **What are the most popular three articles of all time?** Which
  articles have been accessed the most? Present this information as a
  sorted list with the most popular article at the top.
2. **Who are the most popular article authors of all time?** That is,
   when you sum up all of the articles each author has written, which
   authors get the most page views? Present this as a sorted list with
   the most popular author at the top.
3. **On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?** The
   log table includes a column status that indicates the HTTP status
   code that the news site sent to the user's browser. (Refer to this
   lesson for more information about the idea of HTTP status codes.)
